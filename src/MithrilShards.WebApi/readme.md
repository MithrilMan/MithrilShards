### Note about swagger documentation

In order to see comments on swagger ui, you just need to comment your controllers and generate XML documentation during the build process of the assembly containing these controllers.

The easier way is to edit your project file adding this snippet

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>
</PropertyGroup>
```
